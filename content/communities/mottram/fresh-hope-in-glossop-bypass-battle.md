## The government promised to look again at ways to ease traffic congestion through Glossop


Bypass campaigners have been given new hope after the government promised to look again at ways to ease traffic congestion through Glossop.

The treasury has pledged to back a new study into transport links along the Trans Pennine route between Manchester and Sheffield.

Every day up to 36,000 cars and heavy lorries cause severe jams in Tintwistle, Hollingworth and Mottram.

Residents have spent almost 50 years fighting for a bypass to ease traffic problems through the three villages and surrounding areas.

But a new government public spending announcement has sparked fresh hope that a relief road could be on the horizon.

Glossop MP Andrew Bingham said: 
> I’m pleased ministers have taken on board what I’ve been telling them – that there is a major problem here.

> I would prefer the money for a bypass, but everything has to start somewhere, and this feasibility study is a real chance to put the case for a bypass.  It shows the government is taking seriously the traffic problems which not only badly affect residents but also stifle growth in the area.

> I hope that it will prove to the powers-that-be the overwhelming need for something to be done.

Mr Bingham added that he and neighbouring MP Jonathan Reynolds, representing Stalybridge and Hyde, will now be pressing ministers for more details about the study, such as when it will start and report back.

Green campaigners also welcomed the study but said it should look beyond new road building.

Anne Robinson, of the Friends of the Peak District, said: 
>We’re not against having a feasibility study but it should look at all the potential ways across the Pennines.

>It should take account of current thinking - completion of the northern rail hub will improve rail links and mean more services and carriages.

>It should also look at better use of the existing routes, such as weight restrictions, speed and traffic management along the whole of the A628 between Manchester and Sheffield.
